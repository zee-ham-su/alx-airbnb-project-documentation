# Converting Use Case Diagram to User Stories

## Overview
This guide explains how to convert use case diagrams into user stories for agile development.

## What is a Use Case Diagram?

A use case diagram is a UML diagram that shows the interactions between actors (users) and the system. It captures:
- Actors (users/roles)
- Use cases (actions/goals)
- Relationships between actors and use cases

## What is a User Story? 
A user story is a short description of functionality from an end user perspective, following the format:
"As a [role], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"

## Conversion Process

1. Identify Actors
   - Each actor in the use case diagram becomes a role in user stories
   - Example: Admin, Guest, Host

2. Convert Use Cases to Actions
   - Each use case becomes an action in user stories
   - Focus on the goal/outcome
   - Example: "Login to System" becomes "log in"

3. Determine Benefits
   - Add business value/benefit for each action
   - Answer "Why does the user want to do this?"

4. Write User Stories
   - Combine role + action + benefit
   - Example: "As a Customer, I want to log in so that I can access my account"

5. Add Acceptance Criteria
   - Include conditions that must be met
   - Add specific requirements/constraints
   - Example: "Must validate username/password"

## Example Conversion

Use Case:

- Actor: Guest
- Use Case: Register

Becomes User Story:
"As a guest, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties."

Acceptance Criteria:

- Must provide valid email and password
- Must confirm password matches
- Must ensure email is unique
- Must receive registration success message
- Must be redirected to dashboard upon success
- Must handle errors gracefully

## Best Practices

1. Keep stories simple and focused
2. Use clear, non-technical language
3. Include measurable acceptance criteria
4. Break large use cases into smaller stories
5. Maintain traceability to use cases
6. Review with stakeholders
7. Prioritize stories for development

## Benefits

- More detailed requirements
- Better user focus
- Clearer development priorities
- Easier estimation
- Improved tracking
- Better communication
